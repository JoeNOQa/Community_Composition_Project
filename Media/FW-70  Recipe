Freshwater Media Protocol (FW_70)
Last Edited: September 29th, 2022
1. Obtain desired masses for ingredients
Obtain “X” volume of DI Water
Obtain mass such that Sodium Pyruvate
and Casamino Acids have a
concentration of 1g/L of Media
Obtain mass such that concentration of
Gellan Gum = 10g/L of Media
Desired volume:
Mass of Sodium Pyruvate:
Mass of Gellan Gum:
Mass of Casamino Acids:
2. Preparing the media
Add “X mL” of DI water to a clean glass
bottle, place on a stir plate and add a
sterilized stir bar.
Add “0.001X g” of Sodium Pyruvate and
Casamino Acids
Add “0.01X g” of Gellan Gum
Stir until a homogeneous-looking mixture
is formed.
Close the bottle halfway through and
autoclave for 20 minutes.
3. Plating
After autoclaving, pour approximately
20mL of media onto each petri dish.
*If the media starts solidifying
before finishing the plating, proceed to
place the bottle into a heat plate, then
draw 20mL using a serological pipette into
each petri dish manually.*
